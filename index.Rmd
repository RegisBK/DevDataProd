## Purpose
<br>
This app was designed to allow teachers at an organization to view the results of a survey conducted in their classes and download summary data tables for each question.  
<br>

App features:  
* Generates graph of responses for each question separated by the final course grade of the respondent from raw data <br>

* Users have the option to also view a table of responses corresponding to bar heights
* Users can download summary table as a csv file 
* Users can view the grade distribution for the entire class

## R Utilization

* If a new data set is uploaded, the basic display and table code can remain the same
* Calculations and plots are generated as the question selection is made

## Sample R Code

Sample R code for generating table and total row using mtcars dataset similar to what is used to generate table in Survey App
```{r}
data(mtcars)
df<- as.data.frame.matrix(t(table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$am)))
colnames(df)<-c("4 cyl","6 cyl","8 cyl")
rownames(df)<-c("automatic", "manual")
df["Total" ,] <-as.integer(colSums(df))
print(df)
```

## Summary

* This app was developed for use by organizations that administer similar surveys over periods of time
* New data can be uploaded and analyzed using same underlying code
* Users can generate charts and tables dynamically to explore the data and draw conclusions
* Users interested in manipulating data on their own can download summary csv files
